\begin{itemize}
\item This is an experimental hackety hack -- things may just not work! More a proof-of-concept rather than a stable solution on Overleaf at present.
\item tex4ht doesn't work well with \verb|fontspec| nor \verb|authblk|.
\item Avoid \verb|\mathbf| -- this broke MathML and MathJax for me.
\item Avoid, or re-define the \verb|multicol| environment to do nothing -- tex4ht will really export text in two or three columns \emph{by PDF page}, and it's not the most readable.
\end{itemize}
